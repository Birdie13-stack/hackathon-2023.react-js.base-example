# SheSharp x Create React App

This boilerplate was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Some CRA files have been removed and cleaned up to provide a simple starting place.

## Available Scripts

You can run these from the command line of your project to see how your application is coming along.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
